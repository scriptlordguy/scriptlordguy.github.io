# scriptlordguy.github.io
A minimal GitHub Pages site for the Boblox project.

## Website
This repository hosts a placeholder website for **Boblox**. The site is currently a simple "Coming soon" page (`index.html`).

Once you're ready, you can replace the placeholder with the full Boblox site content.

## Local preview

You can preview the site locally with either Python or Node.js.

- Using Python 3 (no dependencies):

# run the local server (defaults to port 8000)

```
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

- Using Node.js (no extra packages required):
